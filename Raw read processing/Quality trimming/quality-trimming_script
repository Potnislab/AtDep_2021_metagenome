1.	The first step after receiving the raw reads from sequencing is trimming for adapter and contaminant removal. We used BBDuk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/) to align our metagenomic reads to the adapter file and remove those adapters to obtain a clean output file without adapters. We loaded BBMap from the module as it was already installed in the cluster.

#!/bin/bash
source /opt/asn/etc/asn-bash-profiles-special/modules.sh
module load bbmap/37.36
for fq1 in ./*_R1_001.fastq.gz
    do
    echo "working with file $fq1"
    base=$(basename $fq1 _R1_001.fastq.gz)
    echo "base name is $base"
    fq1=./${base}_R1_001.fastq.gz
    fq2=./${base}_R2_001.fastq.gz
bbduk.sh -Xmx1g in1=$fq1 in2=$fq2 out1=${base}.clean1.fq out2=${base}.clean2.fq ref=adapter.fa ktrim=r k=23 mink=11 hdist=1 tpe tbo

bbduk.sh -Xmx1g in1=${base}.clean1.fq in2=${base}.clean2.fq out1=${base}.clean_trim1.fq out2=${base}.clean_trim2.fq qtrim=rl trimq=10
done

2.	The adapter trimmed reads were then trimmed for quality using SolexaQA++ (https://solexaqa.sourceforge.net). Dynamictrim and Lengthsort algorithm of the program was used to remove the poor-quality reads with Phred quality score <20 and length less than 50bp

#!/bin/bash
source /opt/asn/etc/asn-bash-profiles-special/modules.sh
module load solexaqa/3.1.7.1
for F in *.fq; do
N=$(basename $F .fq) ;
SolexaQA++ dynamictrim -h 20 $F ; done

And for length

#!/bin/bash
source /opt/asn/etc/asn-bash-profiles-special/modules.sh
module load solexaqa/3.1.7.1
for F in *.trimmed; do N=$(basename $F .trimmed) ;
SolexaQA++ lengthsort -l 50 $F ; done
